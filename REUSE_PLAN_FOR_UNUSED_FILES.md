# Reuse Plan for Previously Flagged Files / Folders

Date: 2025-10-07

This document summarizes the analysis and practical reuse plan for the folders that were previously flagged as "unused". Instead of deleting, we will integrate and repurpose these modules.

---

## 1) accessibility/

- What exists: `AccessibilityService`, `AccessibilitySettings` model + generated Hive adapters, helper utilities, audits & recommendations.
- Reuse plan:
  1. Initialize `AccessibilityService` at app startup (after DB init). Done in `main.dart`.
  2. Wire `AccessibilitySettings` to ThemeProvider or settings UI so font scale and contrast can affect the app's appearance.
  3. Add a Settings entry / screen to control accessibility options and to run accessibility audits.

## 2) advanced_reporting/

- What exists: `ReportData`, `ReportTemplate`, `InsightData` models with adapters.
- Reuse plan:
  1. Implement a lightweight `AdvancedReportingService` that aggregates analytics and generates `ReportData` objects.
  2. Add a Reports screen to view/generate/export reports.

## 3) backup_sync/

- What exists: `BackupData`, `SyncSettings` and adapters.
- Reuse plan:
  1. Provide Export/Import backup UI under Settings.
  2. Use `SyncSettings` to control automatic backups; integrate with `OfflineModeService` for queued uploads.

## 4) calendar_integration/

- What exists: `CalendarIntegrationService` with event creation, recurring events handling, syncing and reminders.
- Reuse plan:
  1. Use `createEventsFromHabits` to create calendar events for habits when user saves/activates habit reminders.
  2. Integrate `getEventsForDate` into Daily/Calendar screens to surface calendar events and reminders.

## 5) offline_mode/

- What exists: `OfflineModeService` with queueing, sync sessions, caching, connectivity monitoring.
- Reuse plan:
  1. Initialize `OfflineModeService` at startup (after DB init). Done in `main.dart`.
  2. Use `queueOperation` from services that perform remote operations so app works offline.
  3. Expose sync stats in Settings or Debug UI.

## 6) habits/

- What exists: a re-export pointing to `core/models/habit.dart`.
- Reuse plan:
  1. Keep the re-export; if we need habit-specific UI/providers, add them under this folder using `core/models/habit.dart`.

## Next steps (practical tasks):

1. Wire Accessibility settings into Theme system (fontScale, highContrast). (Small task)
2. Add a Settings page section for Accessibility (toggle options + run audit). (Small task)
3. Add Backup/Restore UI under Settings that uses `BackupData`. (Medium)
4. Wire CalendarIntegration to Habits provider so habit reminders create calendar events. (Medium)
5. Ensure `OfflineModeService.queueOperation` is used in services that call remote APIs (Medium-Hard depending on API surfaces).
